# cnn-hog-image-classification
A scratch implementation of research paper [Convolutional Neural Networks for Facial Expression Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2016/pdfs/005_Report.pdf).

An ablation study was done in this paper to add HoG features with CNN features before feeding features to classification layers. Alone CNN layers performed better in our case and same results was claimed in paper as well. Famous kaggle dataset [Challenges in Representation Learning: Facial Expression Recognition Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data) was utilized in this experiment.
